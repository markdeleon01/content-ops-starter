## Problem: 65% of Your Revenue Could Be Going to Waste

You became a dentist to care for patients—not chase claims and reschedule appointments.

### High Overhead Costs

Over $40k annual salary costs for local assistants.

### Unmanageable Staffing Stress

6 in 10 dentists say hiring is their biggest headache.

### Crippling Accounts Receivable Bottlenecks

Unpaid or aging claims lock up thousands in revenue, leaving money on the table that should already be in your practice’s account.

### Tiring Manual Workflows

Outdated systems and task overload waste more than 20 hours per week, draining your team and burning valuable time.
